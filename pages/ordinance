        These are two seperate projects I did, a map created in ArcGIS, and a data biography using Python, all using a dataset focused on the British Ordinance Survey,
        a census-like spatial account of everything inside Great Britian at the turn of the 19th century. 
        These projects were for GEOG 4080: Intro to GIS and HIST 4261: Working with Data, both attended at CU Denver.

      <h3>Digging into the British Ordinance Survey of 1888-1914 with Python</h3>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In the late 19th century, technological and economic progress came to a head with what historians today call "the Second Industrial Revolution," a time period of 
        large industrial growth spurred on by new manufacturing techniques such as the Bessemer process and the telegraph. One technique that drove this new evolution was the 
        development and wide-scale production of interchangable parts, leading to a period of mass production. The colonial system was an essential cog in this shift as it provided
        the raw materials that were needed, and no colonial power benefitted more profoundly than the British Empire.
        The lives of humans have drastically changed as a result of these societal evolutions, and as a result, so has the land we inhabit. 
        Our cities and farms have changed forever, and we are still dealing with the consequences. Understanding how and why our cities came to be is the first, 
        and most essential, step in dealing with how we start to fix the places we inhabit.

      <p>
        Dating back to the 1700s, the British Ordanance Survey has taken on many forms. In the 21st century, it acts as a modern census, giving the government important demographic 
        statistics, such as age, gender, race, employment, and more, similar to the US Census many Americans are familiar with. However, the original purpose was in Scotland, 
        where the English military created maps to crack down on dissent in the aftermath of the Jacobite rebellions. The dataset I am exploring for this project will be the 
        data collected in the Ordinance Survey of 1900, which was collected over the years 1888-1914. In this project, I will use this dataset to create maps and charts that 
        will show the geographic distribution of industrialzation on the island of Great Britain. The goal is to paint a picture of how the land was changed, as well as where
        it was changed, to try and answer larger questions on historical urban development and effective land use.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        In today's world, the Ordnance Survey is an agency within the UK's Department for Science, Information, and Techonology, but historically, 
        the work was collected by the government through the military. This fact, combined with the bloody origin story, tell a story that focus 
        on control of the population, not informing them. So as a result, we must be aware that the dataset is not completely accurate, and does 
        not include every data point. As referenced within some of larger themes from the work by D’Ignazio and Klein, Data Feminism, the data within 
        the Ordnance Survey tells us more than what is collected. Building on their idea that "what gets counted counts," we must be aware that the 
        team put in charge of this survey were tasked with focusing on property rights and taxation, as well as military purposes, which means there
        were places that were left off, whether intentionally or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that being said, the dataset is absolutely huge. Like HUGE. Over two and a half million entries, more than any sane person could parse through.
        I need to especially thank everyone who originally collected, digitized, and organized the data, a group of over one thousand volunteers, led by 
        researchers from the University of Portsmouth, the GB Historial GIS, the National Library of Scotland, among many other institutions within the UK. 
        The scale of this data is so vast, that I am going to break it down into more manageable chunks of data. To do this process, I am going to filter through
        the place name value within the dataset and sort based on keyword, and isolate any buildings that have an industrial connotation. Building on the themes 
        of Data Feminism, there might be some places missing from this data, as there could have been bribery or corruption in order to help capitalists avoid taxes, 
        or local rivalries exploited to aquire business enemies' lands. On the other hand, there could be places that get flagged by the industrial keyword filter 
        that had little to no industrial impact, or even could have been typos, overstating the real industrial output of certain areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        The over two million entries has been narrowed down to around 50 thousand, which is more manageable for making charts, graphs, and maps, all showing 
        industrial impact on the cities of the UK. Reflecting the themes of our reference book once again, Data Feminism, we must be aware that this data has been 
        filtered once again. The choices I, along with ChatGPT, made, actively left out aspects of the data due to our arbitrary cutoff. The pie chart below highlights 
        the top 15 results of the 'name' column, showing the highest values of our filtered dataset.

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        As this project aims to explore geographic data, I am going to do the bulk of the analysis section using maps created by Folium, a program within 
        python that creates interactive maps from datasets. Exploring geographic data can reveal larger trends that are noticable visually, as well as 
        helping show spatial relationships that are not immediately found out. Using the location data within the Ordnance Survey dataset can show how and 
        where Great Britain developed, as well as highlighting trends.

      <p>
        This visualization uses the density of points within a dataset to build a heatmap, using color and opacity level to show the viewer the patterns that 
        lie within the data. The heatmap here shows the density of buildings that we filtered through, showing a strong bias toward what is referred to as the
        English Midlands, focusing around the cities of Birmingham and Manchester. This supports the ideas of Romola Davenport, a researcher at the University 
        of Cambridge, who claims that "coal provided cheap, abundant fuel for both industrial and domestic uses, and it drove the transformation of the British 
        and then the global economy from an organic system dependent on sun and soil to our modern fossil fuel-based system of the significant coal fields." 
        Building on that, many urban areas sprouted up next to these coal fields due to the high cost of transporting coal.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This region in particular became so prominent in the mining and manufacturing sector due to the proximity to the coastline, as transporting coal on 
        ships was the most common way of moving the good. Davenport even goes on to note that "since the coalfields were often located in relatively inaccessible
        inland and upland areas, the growth of these areas spurred what has been called the ‘transport revolution’ – the rapid development of canals and road 
        networks to connect the coalfields with the rest of the country." This transport bottleneck combined with the increasing specialization within various 
        industries created an economic cycle where this region became the dominant player in this system. The interactable heatmap below shows the location and 
        name of all data points within the Greater Manchester region.

        Denver has achieved substantial infrastructure growth over 32 years, expanding from 180 to 850 miles, and has demonstrated sustained planning commitment through multiple master plans and the initiative of Vision Zero. Meanwhile, safety and usage goals from 1993 remain largely unmet, with the main challenge being that the 1 mile grid concept was never fully explored. The result has been a fragmented network with “bikeways to nowhere” rather than the comprehensive system originally planned.
        The recent cyclist deaths in early 2025 underscore continued urgency. Achieving the Vision Zero 2030 goal requires addressing fundamental connectivity gaps rather than simply building more miles in isolation. The grid concept from ‘93 remains relevant to this day because it focused on connecting the network up in ways that benefited all users. A truly connected system throughout Denver could finally deliver on the safety, climate, and livability goals that have guided the city’s blossoming into a global city. The question is whether Denver will learn from the previous three decades, or continue the pattern that has not produced the results we are striving toward.
